## **Minimally Ricing my Desktop on Ubuntu**

- **Terminal:** I initially explored the options provided in the default (bash) shell's *preferences*; There weren't many options. Consequently, I switched the default shell from *bash* to *zsh* and used *powerlevel10k* to customise my terminal. The screenshot shows the terminal displaying the results of *neofetch* and running the *cmatrix* command.

- **Desktop Environment:** I went through many articles including those about *komorebi* (for live wallpapers) and Pratap Kumar's *ubuntu-gdm-set-background* (for setting a background for the login page). But for some reason I was unsuccessful in being able to use them. Finally, and fortunately, I came to know about *GNOME Shell Extensions* and life became simpler ever since.

    Following are some of the extensions that I added:
    - Caffeine
    - Vitals
    - RunCat
    - WinTile
    - Dash to Dock
    - ArcMenu
