Level 0: Customize Your Desktop Environment (PS 0.1)

I use a MacBook Air (intel chip).
Hence I customised my desktop environment using 'geektool', using various 'geeklets'. 
I first set my wallpaper to a war picture that I found on the internet.
Then added time, date, day stamps using 'shell' on geektool.
I added a spotify widget using a spotify geeklet that I found on a random reddit post that had geeklets and scripts for various tasks like temperature, music, calendar, stocks etc.
The spotify widget shows the album image, track name and the artist name.

Then I installed neofetch (works on unix) using homebrew on my in built terminal. 

And Internet Explorer is the most used browser
to install other browsers XD
Thanks.
