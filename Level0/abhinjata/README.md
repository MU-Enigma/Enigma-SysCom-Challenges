**Image 1: Riced Up Pop-OS**

You can find a few different CLI tools/programs running on the screen

- Cmatrix: a command-line program that creates a "Matrix" movie-style cascading code effect in a terminal. It fills the terminal screen with random characters or "rain" of letters that fall from the top to the bottom, resembling the iconic green code seen in The Matrix films.
- Neofetch | Popcat: Neofetch displays system information, such as OS, kernel version, CPU, GPU, RAM usage, and more, in a stylish way, often with an ASCII logo of the Linux distribution while popcat is a meme-like command that animates the "Pop Cat" character to open and close its mouth whenever it receives input. It doesnâ€™t perform any actual system tasks but is a fun little animation tool in the terminal.
  - The '|' combines both the programs to get the peak ricing game :coolsunglasses:
- Btop: a resource monitor for Linux, macOS, and Windows, providing a visually appealing and interactive way to monitor system resources in the terminal. It's a cooler task manager.

- Icon Packs using Gnome Extensions: Gnome or GNU Network Object Model Environment is a popular desktop environment primarily used in Linux distributions, providing a graphical user interface (GUI) that makes using a Linux system more accessible and visually appealing. GNOME focuses on simplicity, ease of use, and a clean, modern aesthetic.
